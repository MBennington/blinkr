# Blinkr
Blinkr is a simple desktop application that helps you take care of your eyes by reminding you to blink regularly.

## Why is it important to blink?
Blinking is a natural process that helps to keep our eyes hydrated and healthy. It is essential for keeping the eyes clean, moist, and lubricated. However, when we are staring at a computer screen or any other digital device, we tend to blink less frequently. This can cause eye strain, dry eyes, and other eye-related problems.

## How Blinkr works?
Blinkr is a lightweight and easy-to-use desktop application that runs in the background and reminds you to blink regularly. It works by displaying a pop-up notification at regular intervals reminding you to blink your eyes. You can customize the frequency and duration of these notifications as per your preference.
